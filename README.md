**Sorting Arena**

The Sorting Arena tests many efficient sorting algorithms on integer data, allowing us to see how these algorithms - coded on C and python - compare on different input sizes. These algorithms include commonly taught algorithms like Quicksort and Heapsort; commonly used algorithms like Timsort and Introsort; and niche algorithms like Library Sort and Patience Sort.

**Algorithms Included**

Currently, the following algorithms are included in the tester, with references for each algorithm I didn't program:

- Library Sort (Gapped binary insertion sort into auxilliary array) 
- Patience Sort (Creates decreasing subsequences with a multi-way merge at the end.)
- Heap Sort - Python implementation is taken from https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-program-for-heap-sort/
- Shell Sort - Python implementation is taken from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellsort
- Quick Sort - Python implementation is taken from https://www.programiz.com/dsa/quick-sort
- Quick Sort with O(n) worst-case median-finding algorithm
- Intro Sort
- Tim Sort (Adaptive Merge Sort using a stack to decide when to merge groups) - Taken from https://github.com/patperry/timsort/tree/master
- Python standard library sort (optimized implementation of Timsort)
- Numpy sort + stablesort (extremely optimized implementations of Introsort/Timsort respectively)
